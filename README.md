# Rust In Half An Hour

The code in this repository is based on The
[A half-hour to learn Rust](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust)
article.

```bash
cargo new rust01
```

Found that a lot of stuff is glazed over in the above article
so stopped reading it and started the
[ULTIMATE Rust Lang Tutorial!](https://youtu.be/OX9HJsJUDxA).
